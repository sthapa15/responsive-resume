# Responsive Resume

Resume with fake and innacurate information, created to apply what I learned about JavaScript and jQuery.

### Overview
This project was completed in order to showcase the skills I learned from teaching myself basics of JavaScript and jQuery with the help of Udacity cuourses.
The resume is built by writing a JS script that combines my information with HTML and CSS templates to generate it.  Through building this resume, I gained an understanding of JS syntax, including manipulating data types (JSON), building loops, and creating functions.
Simple jQuery DOM manipulation methods are used to build the resume the moment a user opens up the website.
